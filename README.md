### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently built globetranslator.com, an AI-powered language translation app.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 3 SaaS projects: Defined Recipe, Smart Brain Quiz, and Coworking World. Defined Recipes enables users create recipes with available ingredients, Smart Brain Quiz is an Interactive Quiz App, while Coworking World lists all available coworking spaces in the world.


ðŸŒ± My go-to stack for SaaS products:
Next.js (Typescript and Tailwind CSS)
Supabase (PostgreSQL and Auth)
Vercel

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SaaS Products.


ðŸ’¬ I regularly write articles on my personal website (techlivened.com) alongside other websites.
